<p style="margin: 10px;"><h1>This Can’t Be Us - ONE OK ROCK</h1>
    I hear your voice just like a song<br>
    And your melody, it tells me something's wrong<br>
    They tell me that it won't be long<br>
    But in my head, it feels like you've already gone<br>
    Oh, I don't know what to say<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    I don't know how to say goodbye<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    You've been the greatest part of my life<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    Can we turn back the time?<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    I pray you're waking up<br>
    You gave more than enough<br>
    I won't forget your love<br>
    You've been my rock for way too long<br>
    And I'm sorry that I've been a rolling stone<br>
    You showed me how to build a home<br>
    You said my heart is always with you when you're gone<br>
    Wish you could open up your eyes<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    I don't know how to say goodbye<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    You've been the greatest part of my life<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    Can we turn back the time?<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    I pray you're waking up<br>
    You gave more than enough<br>
    I won't forget your love<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    I don't know how to say goodbye<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    You've been the greatest part of my life<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    Can we turn back the time?<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    I don't know how to say goodbye<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    You've been the greatest part of my life<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    I think I'm going out of my mind<br>
    This can't be us<br>
    And if you don't wake up<br>
    I hope I said enough<br>
    I won't forget your love, mm<br>
