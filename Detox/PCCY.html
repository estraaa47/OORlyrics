<p style="margin: 10px;"><h1>Puppets Can't Control You - ONE OK ROCK</h1>
    Beat me, break me down, but I'm still standing<br>
    Picking pieces off the ground again<br>
    If one day I fall, just hope I stick the landing<br>
    Not at the gates screaming to let me in<br>
    But I don't know where to start<br>
    Damned if I do, it's way too late to fix it<br>
    I'll be damned if I don't, the bane of my existence<br>
    They said, "Damn kid, you gotta try, even if you never win<br>
    You can't pretend you'll never be happy again"<br>
    Clip his wings, he don't deserve the halo<br>
    I'm losing faith in everyone again<br>
    If the TV stations tell their lies on cable<br>
    Then we're so blind that we'll be tuning in<br>
    But I don't know where to start<br>
    Damned if I do, it's way too late to fix it<br>
    I'll be damned if I don't, the bane of my existence<br>
    They said, "Damn kid, you gotta try, even if you never win<br>
    You can't pretend you'll never be happy a-"<br>
    Holding on to nothing 'til it turns into something<br>
    Don't like who I'm becoming, I can't keep running<br>
    Searching for an answer, re-reading every chapter<br>
    There's no happy ever after when it's over<br>
    Damned if I do, it's way too late to fix it<br>
    I'll be damned if I don't, the bane of my existence<br>
    They said, "Damn kid, you gotta try, even if you never win<br>
    You can't pretend you'll never be happy again"<br>
