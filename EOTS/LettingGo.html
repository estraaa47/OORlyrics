<p style="margin: 10px;"><h1>Letting Go - ONE OK ROCK</h1>
I remember getting fucked up on the long nights<br>
I remember how we made up after long fights<br>
I remember when we stayed up 'til the daylight<br>
I remember when you told me you were all mine<br>

Let the past be the past<br>
'Cause I know nothing lasts<br>
Yeah, we had what we had<br>
But I'm moving on<br>

I hope you know<br>
That it wasn't easy<br>
Letting go of the life I knew<br>
I just had to get it out<br>
Move to the city<br>
Didn't feel right<br>
Taking you with me<br>
Hope you know<br>
That it wasn't easy<br>
Letting go<br>

I tell myself that I don't need you, that I'm okay<br>
Tell myself I'm on my own now, go my own way<br>
I see your pictures of your new life, you look happy<br>
Tell myself moving on should be easy<br>

Let the past be the past<br>
'Cause I know nothing lasts<br>
Yeah, we had what we had<br>
But I'm moving on<br>

I hope you know<br>
That it wasn't easy<br>
Letting go of the life I knew<br>
I just had to get it out<br>
Move to the city<br>
Didn't feel right<br>
Taking you with me<br>
Hope you know<br>
That it wasn't easy<br>
Letting go<br>

I was scared of heights before I fell for you<br>
Felt like we had nothing but time<br>
Lied to each other, but we know it's true<br>
Our love was young and born to die<br>

I remember when we stayed up 'til the daylight<br>
I remember when you told me you were all mine<br>

I hope you know<br>
That it wasn't easy<br>
Letting go of the life I knew<br>
I just had to get it out<br>
Move to the city<br>
Didn't feel right<br>
Taking you with me<br>
Hope you know<br>
That it wasn't easy<br>
Letting go<br>

Letting go<br>
Letting go<br>
Letting go<br>
