<p style="margin: 10px;"><h1>Change - ONE OK ROCK</h1>
If we're not moving forward<br>
What are we moving for?<br>
Feels like we're losing order<br>
Fighting a losing war<br>

We need to work this out<br>
Can't do this by myself<br>
How did we let it go this far?<br>

Hey<br>
You know it's not too late for us to make a change<br>
You gotta listen to your heart what does it say?<br>
No matter how much we might bend we will not break<br>
'Cause we got what it takes to stay<br>

I know we got the power<br>
Masters of our own fate<br>
Together we are stronger<br>
As long as we got faith<br>

この声で響かす<br>
SOSのサイン<br>
道なき道を進み目指す場所へ<br>

Hey<br>
You know it's not too late for us to make a change<br>
You gotta listen to your heart what does it say?<br>
No matter how much we might bend, we will not break<br>
'Cause we got what it takes to stay<br>

Stay with me now<br>
And how you like it now?<br>
Just stay with me now<br>
We're looking out<br>
We're looking out, we're looking out now<br>
Stay with me now, with me with me now<br>
Stay we're looking out<br>
Looking out, looking out, looking out<br>

Hey<br>
You know it's not too late for us to make a change<br>
You gotta listen to your heart what does it say?<br>
No matter how much we might bend, we will not break<br>
'Cause we got what it takes to stay<br>

We're looking out<br>
We're looking out<br>
Stay with me now<br>
We're looking out, we're looking out, we're looking out now<br>
Stay we're looking out<br>
We're looking out<br>
Stay, we're looking out, looking out, stay, yeah<br>
