<p style="margin: 10px;"><h1>When They Turn the Lights On - ONE OK ROCK</h1>
I've been climbin’ since I was young<br>
Never stopped to look down<br>
I lost track of the man I was<br>
Took a fall to know how<br>


Selfish, I've been<br>
Oh, what I wouldn't give<br>
To lose it all and find myself<br>


I was broken, I was caught up in the moment<br>
I know that I was wrong<br>
But when they turn the lights on<br>
I’ll be stronger, I can stand a little taller<br>
The darkness will be gone<br>
When they turn the lights on, lights on tonight<br>


I went swimmin' with heavy weights<br>
I was holding my breath<br>
I've been drowning in my mistakes<br>
In a sea of regrets<br>

Selfish, I've been<br>
Oh, what I wouldn't give<br>
To lose it all and find myself<br>


I was broken, I was caught up in the moment<br>
I know that I was wrong<br>
But when they turn the lights on<br>
I'll be stronger, I can stand a little taller<br>
The darkness will be gone<br>
When they turn the lights on, lights on tonight<br>



Needed some reflection in my life<br>
Never seen a vision quite as bright<br>
I just want a second chance to make it better, better<br>
It's never enough<br>


I was broken, I was caught up in the moment<br>
I know that I was wrong<br>
But when they turn the lights on<br>
I'll be stronger, I can stand a little taller<br>
The darkness will be gone<br>
When they turn the lights on (Lights on)<br>


光が暗闇を照らしてゆく<br>
もう恐れるものはない<br>
