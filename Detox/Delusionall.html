<p style="margin: 10px;"><h1>Delusion:All - ONE OK ROCK</h1>
    They'll conquer us if we divide<br>
And no one will listen to you<br>
We gotta stand up and draw a line<br>
It's time to fall back or shoot<br>
Why does it feel like they don't feel anything?<br>
I pray there's a future behind those walls, but maybe I'm delusional<br>
Let's make a deal, pretend this bastard democracy<br>
Is just how we want it and we're not exhausted<br>
But maybe we're delusional<br>
We're all de-fucking-lusional<br>
When everything's supposed to happen for a reason<br>
And every talking head expects ya to believe them<br>
But we don't need them, we are the kingdom<br>
We know the amount that we have shared was never even<br>
Why does it feel like they don't feel anything?<br>
I pray there's a future behind those walls, but maybe I'm delusional<br>
Let's make a deal, pretend this bastard democracy<br>
Is just how we want it and we're not exhausted<br>
I know<br>
In order to be free, you gotta let go<br>
But know that once you do, that's when they take hold<br>
Everything's fair in love and war, so<br>
Why does it feel like they don't feel anything?<br>
I pray there's a future behind those walls, but maybe I'm delusional<br>
Let's make a deal, pretend this bastard democracy<br>
Is just how we want it and we're not exhausted<br>
But maybe we're delusional<br>
But maybe we're delusional<br>
We are delusional, whoa<br>
We're all de-fucking-lusional<br>
