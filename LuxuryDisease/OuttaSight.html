<p style="margin: 10px;"><h1>Outta Sight - ONE OK ROCK</h1>
Take me home<br>
Don't know where to go<br>
Don't know how to feel<br>
When I'm all alone, I'm invisible<br>
You don't care at all<br>
Don't blink, don't stare<br>
When I'm here, you're there<br>
Take me home<br>
Can we just pretend it'll never end?<br>

For you I don't wanna be just another lover<br>
You don't know how to give your heart back<br>

I'm giving up on all my demons<br>
Can't keep up with all their feelings<br>
They string me along and I don't belong<br>
Out of sight, out of mind<br>
I'm giving up on all my demons<br>
Can't keep up with all their feelings<br>
They string me along and I don't belong<br>
Out of sight, out of mind (I'm giving up)<br>

Used to give me everything I needed<br>
'Til I needed something to believe in<br>
When you said forever, guess you didn't mean it<br>
Lying to my face, and now I see it, yeah<br>
Don't blink, don't stare<br>
When you're standing here, are you really there?<br>
When the rain is gone, are you moving on?<br>
'Cause I'm holding on to you<br>
Don't know how to give your heart back<br>

I'm giving up on all my demons<br>
Can't keep up with all their feelings<br>
They string me along and I don't belong<br>
Out of sight, out of mind<br>
I'm giving up on all my demons<br>
Can't keep up with all their feelings<br>
They string me along and I don't belong<br>
Out of sight, out of mind (I'm giving up)<br>

(Out of sight, out of mind, I'm giving up)<br>

(Don't know how to give your heart back)<br>

I'm giving up on all my demons<br>
Can't keep up with all their feelings<br>
They string me along and I don't belong<br>
Out of sight, out of mind<br>
I'm giving up on all my demons<br>
Can't keep up with all their feelings<br>
They string me along and I don't belong<br>
Out of sight, out of mind<br>

(Out of sight, out of mind, I'm giving up)<br>
(Out of sight, out of mind) I'm giving up<br>
